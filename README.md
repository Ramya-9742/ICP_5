1. Adding one more hidden layer to autoencoder 2. Doing the prediction on the test data and then visualizing one of the reconstructed version of that test data. Also, visualizing the same test data before reconstruction using Matplotlib 3. Repeating the above process on the denoisening autoencoder 4. plotting loss and accuracy using the history object
